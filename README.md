# Chess Game with PyQt5

A standalone chess game implemented with PyQt5, featuring a graphical user interface and chess game logic.

## Features

- Complete chess rules implementation
- Multiple board themes
- Two-player mode and play against simple AI
- Move highlighting
- Check and checkmate detection
- Pawn promotion
- Simple AI opponent

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5
- PyInstaller (for building the executable)

## Installation

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5 PyInstaller
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```
   python chess_game.py
   ```

## Building an Executable

To build a standalone executable that can be distributed without Python:

1. Run the build script:
   ```
   python build_exe.py
   ```

2. The executable will be created in the `dist` directory

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the executable or Python script
2. Choose game mode: Two Player or vs AI
3. White moves first
4. Click on a piece to select it, then click on a highlighted square to move
5. When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, a promotion dialog will appear

## Game Controls

- **Standard/Vintage/Dark/High Contrast buttons**: Change the board theme
- **Two Player/vs AI buttons**: Switch between game modes
- **New Game button**: Reset the game
- **Quit button**: Exit the application

## Directory Structure

```
chess_game/
├── chess_game.py      # Main game file
├── build_exe.py       # Script to build executable
├── images/            # Chess piece images
│   ├── wK.png         # White King
│   ├── wQ.png         # White Queen
│   └── ...            # Other piece images
└── dist/              # Generated by build script
    └── ChessGame.exe  # Windows executable
```

## Notes

- The game requires chess piece images in PNG format named with the following convention:
  - First letter: 'w' for white, 'b' for black
  - Second letter: 'K' (king), 'Q' (queen), 'R' (rook), 'B' (bishop), 'N' (knight), 'P' (pawn)
  - Example: 'wK.png' for white king

- The images directory should be in the same directory as the script or executable

## How to Customize

- To change piece images, replace the PNG files in the 'images' directory
- To modify the AI behavior, edit the `make_ai_move` method in the ChessLogic class
